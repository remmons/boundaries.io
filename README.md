# boundaries.io

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jbielick/boundaries.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jbielick/boundaries.io)

boundaries.io is an API for retrieving GeoJSON for common US geographic topologies.
Data is mostly comprised of US Census TIGER data—yielding up-to-date information on the
census-defined geographies converted from Shapefile format.

You can query the boundaries.io API for free to retrieve GeoJSON documents with the
same meta properties as the original shapefiles.

## API Endpoints

Available geographies are as follows:

`states`
`postal-codes`
`places`
`neighborhoods`
`counties`

These can be substituted anywhere a url references a path segment `{geography}`


Text Search
---

`geographies/{geography}?search={query}`

Geographies can be searched via text to match against all attributes. This is
helpful as the property names for certain geographies can be very specific in nature
to the geography or datasource. For instance, a common 5-digit US postal code is contained
in the property `properties.ZCTA5CE10` in the `postal-codes` geography. In order to not keep
track of specific collection-based common names like `ZCTA5CE10`, a search paramter is used on
the `geographies/{geography}` endpoint to search all text fields for a url query `?search`.

Example:

```
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' http://boundaries.io/geographies/postal-codes?search=33060
```


Where Am I?
---

`geographies/{geography}/whereami?lat={latitude}&lng={longitude}`

When querying the `whereami` endpoint, the geography that contains the provided latitude/longitude pair will be returned if found.
For instance, when requesting `geographies/postal-codes/whereami?lat=36.011616617997426&lng=-78.9103317260742`,
the GeoJSON for postal-code 27701 will be returned as the lat/lng pair in the querystring is contained
in the postal-code geography 27701. The corresponding `states` geography would be north carolina.

The corresponding mongodb geospatial query operator is `$geoIntersects`.

Example:

```
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' http://boundaries.io/geographies/postal-codes/whereami?lat=36.011616617997426&lng=-78.9103317260742
```


Named
---

`geographies/{geography}/named/{name}`

The typical name key for geographies from the US Census TIGER shapefiles is `properties.NAME`, but for postal-codes is
`properties.ZCTA5CE10`. Geographies can be queried against the identifying key with the `named` endpoint.
By making a request to the `named` endpoint, a geography collection can be queried by its common
name property. For postal codes this is the 5-digit common code. For states this is the state name.

Example:

```
curl -H 'accept: application/json' http://boundaries.io/geographies/postal-codes/named/27705
curl -H 'accept: application/json' http://boundaries.io/geographies/states/named/north%20carolina
```

Named (SVG Image)
---

`geographies/{geography}/named/{name}.svg`

Parameters:

`width`, `height`, `stroke`, `fill`

Example:

```
curl http://boundaries.io/geographies/states/named/north%20carolina.svg
# => <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="300" height="300">
#        <path d="M64.0623532378737,21.511595932804283
```


Near Me
---

`geographies/{geography}/nearme?lat={latitude}&lng={longitude}`

Similar to the `whereami` endpoint, one can query the nearby geographies with the `nearme` endpoint. Simply provide a lat/lng

The corresponding mongodb geospatial query operator is `$near`.

Example:

```
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' http://boundaries.io/geographies/postal-codes/nearme?lat=36.011616617997426&lng=-78.9103317260742
```

Requesting TopoJSON data:
---

The API may also be able to reduce large GeoJSON features by up to 80% in size using `topojson`. To
request topojson topologies instead of GeoJSON, simply use an `Accept: application/topojson` header
in your request to the API. If possible, the geography will be encoded into a topology.
See [`topojson.feature`](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki/API-Reference#feature) for info
on transforming this back to GeoJSON on the client side.

### Where did the data come from?

Counties, States, Zips, and Places data were collected from
[The US Census Bureau Tiger/Line® Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html)

Neighborhood data was sourced from
[Zillow's Neighborhood Boundaries](http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/neighborhood-boundaries.htm) shapefile
data and the [Durham Hoods](http://durhamhoods.com/) project.

### Setting up a development environment

A development environment can be setup expediently with docker-compose. Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/) (or your platform) and run `docker-compose up` to get the server up and running.



The application should then be available at `localhost:3334` from your host machine (or docker machine).

To import `states`, `postalcodes` or other features, just use the singular version in a make
command like:

```
  make state
```

The TIGER2014 data should download, unzip, convert to GeoJSON,
import into the local dev mongo database `geo`, and create the necessary geo spatial indexes
for you.

Or use `mongorestore ./dump` after downloading and extracting a [mongodump of the production database](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jb-storage/geo.tar.gz). Docker-compose will expose the mongo database on port 27017 of your localhost, so no connection details are necessary.
